Our first project as a videogame studio is a functional version of the classic "Bomberman: Panic Bomber" of 1994 released for the Neo Geo, a falling blocks puzzle game based on the Bomberman franchise. The goal of the game is essentially to cause your opponent to lose by causing their gameplay field to fill to the top with objects.
